# savegame-copy
A small copy utility for making savegame backups.

Add escaped absolute paths of live and backup save directories, e.g.
```
{
    "LiveDirectory": "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\userdata\\yoursteamid\\gameid",
    "BackupDirectory": "C:\\Users\\yourname\\Documents\\SaveGameCopyBackup\\game"
}
```
There is no built-in safety - the program performs simple copy/pastes. Use at your own risk.
